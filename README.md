# cve
* A collection of other people's code pertaining to CVE-2016-0728
* I added comments to the exploid code (expl.c) to explain what each line does.
* I included the first emergency patch from January 2016
* For systems that don't implement the keycntl wrappers, I made a version (andr.c) that skips the wrappers
